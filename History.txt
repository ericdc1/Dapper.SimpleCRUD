* version 1.0:  Initial Release
* version 1.0.1: Added comments to methods, refactored get and delete(id) methods to allow only one key in the entity
* version 1.0.2: Added ability to include complex types in insert and update operations by decorating them with the Editable(true) attribute - useful for enumerators
* version 1.0.3: Added GetList() without where filter and corresponding tests. Fixed package reference to Dapper in test project. Fixed bug with null parameter in GetList(object where).
* version 1.0.4: Added nullable types to SimpleTypes allowed list. Add a test for this case. Added sql statements to output window when debugger is attached
* version 1.0.5: Updated documentation
* version 1.0.6: Allow newer Dapper version
* version 1.0.7: Fix bug when last property is a key and generated sql ended with trailing comma. Added T4 template to generate POCOs. Added sample website project using the T4 and SimpleCRUD
* version 1.1.0: Allow table attribute to inherit. Incremented minor version here as I should have done that with the prior few releases
* version 1.1.1: Added XML doc to nuget package
* version 1.1.2: Improved xml comments
* version 1.1.3: Improved xml comments
* version 1.2.0: Added changes from YogirajA to support transactions, and changes to avoid multiple enumeration
* version 1.3.0: Support for multiple schemas, non int primary keys. Fixed issue with editable attribute annotations. Made enums be considered "editable" so you can have integers in the database and represent them as enums in the code and have SimpleCRUD map them without extra pain. 
* version 1.4.0: Switched to using Nullable.GetUnderlyingType(type) so we don't need to explicitly check for all nullable types. This also has the side effect of fixing checks for nullable enums without the editable attribute.
