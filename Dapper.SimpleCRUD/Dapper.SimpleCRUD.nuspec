      * version 1.0:  Initial Release
      * version 1.0.1: Added comments to methods, refactored get and delete(id) methods to allow only one key in the entity
      * version 1.0.2: Added ability to include complex types in insert and update operations by decorating them with the Editable(true) attribute - useful for enumerators
      * version 1.0.3: Added GetList() without where filter and corresponding tests. Fixed package reference to Dapper in test project. Fixed bug with null parameter in GetList(object where).
      * version 1.0.4: Added nullable types to SimpleTypes allowed list. Add a test for this case. Added sql statements to output window when debugger is attached.
      * version 1.0.5: Updated documentation
      * version 1.0.6: Allow newer Dapper version
      * version 1.0.7: Fix bug when last property is a key and generated sql ended with trailing comma. Added T4 template to generate POCOs. Added sample website project using the T4 and SimpleCRUD
      * version 1.1.0: Allow table attribute to inherit. Incremented minor version here as I should have done that with the prior few releases
